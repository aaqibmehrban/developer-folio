      <p className="mt-4 text-white">
      From the beginning of my academic journey in Geoinformatics Engineering at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), I have been passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. My early foray into freelancing allowed me to work with over 100 clients globally, honing my skills in writing extensions for QGIS, data visualization, image processing, and structuring databases in PostgreSQL.

Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of building software across various domains, including advertising, start-ups, large corporations, and digital product studios. Currently, as a Full Stack Developer, I lead a team in designing scalable and efficient products, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance performance and reduce maintenance costs.
